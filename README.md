# ⚡ PowerShell Automation Scripts  

This repository contains simple PowerShell scripts I wrote to make daily IT support and system maintenance tasks easier.  
👉 It is also one of the first steps in my **Back to Tech Challenge** journey, where I rebuild my hands-on skills and share my progress.

---

## 🎯 Purpose
- Speed up daily system checks  
- Automate repetitive or manual tasks  
- Improve troubleshooting and documentation habits  
- Share what I learn while preparing for IT Support and Security roles

## 🔧 Usage

Open PowerShell **as Administrator** and run the scripts from the project folder.

### System Health Check
```powershell
# Run with default thresholds (CPU 80%, RAM 85%, Disk free 5GB)
.\scripts\System-Health-Check.ps1

# Custom thresholds
.\scripts\System-Health-Check.ps1 -CpuThreshold 70 -MemThreshold 80 -DiskFreeThresholdGB 10

# Custom log file path
.\scripts\System-Health-Check.ps1 -LogPath "C:\Temp\healthcheck.log"
```

### Log Cleanup
```powershell
# Test mode (no deletion)
.\scripts\Log-Cleanup.ps1 -Paths "C:\Logs","C:\Temp" -DaysOld 20 -WhatIf

# Real cleanup
.\scripts\Log-Cleanup.ps1 -Paths "C:\Logs","C:\Temp" -DaysOld 30
```
- Generates a report file like `LogCleanup_Report_20251022_2000.txt`
- Use `-WhatIf` first to confirm what will be deleted
- Run as **Administrator** for system folders



### Network Diagnose
```powershell
# Save report to file
.\scripts\Network-Diagnose.ps1 -ReportPath "C:\Temp\netdiag_report.txt

# Custom targets and DNS names
.\scripts\Network-Diagnose.ps1 -Targets "8.8.8.8","8.8.4.4" -DnsNames "www.microsoft.com","www.github.com"

# Specific adapter and timeout
.\scripts\Network-Diagnose.ps1 -AdapterName "Wi-Fi" -TimeoutSec 2

```
- Works with PowerShell 7+
- Runs safe, read-only connectivity checks (no configuration changes)
- Tests adapter, gateway, DNS resolution, and ping reachability.
- Displays live results and can generate a full text report when -ReportPath is specified.

## ⚙️ Requirements
- Windows 10/11 or Windows Server 2016+  
- PowerShell 5.1+ or PowerShell 7+  
- Admin rights for protected system folders  

---

## 🛡️ Safety
- Always test with the `-WhatIf` flag before running cleanup or deletion commands.  
- Read the generated report before removing files permanently.  
- Backup important log folders if used for audits or monitoring.

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap (Coming Soon)
- `scripts/Network-Diagnose.ps1` → basic connectivity, ping, DNS, gateway, and adapter checks  
- `scripts/Outlook-Repair.ps1` → Outlook safe mode, cache clear, and add-in reset  
- `scripts/AD-User-Assist.ps1` → quick user management commands (reset, unlock, group check)  
- `scripts/Update-Remediation.ps1` → WSUS cleanup and Windows Update cache reset  
- `scripts/EventLog-Export.ps1` → export recent error and warning logs to CSV  
- `configs/cleanup-config.json` → define folder paths and retention days for Log Cleanup v2  

---

## 📘 Example Config File (for Log-Cleanup v2)
`configs/cleanup-config.json`
```json
{
  "DaysOld": 14,
  "Paths": [
    "C:\Logs",
    "C:\Temp",
    "C:\Windows\Temp"
  ]
}
```
*(Log-Cleanup v2 will read this file automatically to manage different folders.)*

## 🧩 Troubleshooting
For common script errors and fixes, see [docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

Typical issues:
- Missing PowerShell modules → install via `Install-Module -Name PSWindowsUpdate`
- Execution Policy → run `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`
- Permission errors → start PowerShell as Administrator
